- The build process (may it be triggered by a commit, or just run as a nightly task) should happen in a clean environment, simulating a fresh Haskell Platform environment, thus only having Cabal (and cabal-install) and GHC together with their dependencies.
- We're currently investigating how the isolation will be performed: hsenv, virthualenv or just cabal-dev.
- It should be able to fetch packages either from Hackage or from repositories (darcs for sure, and probably git too -- darcs-bridge?).
- It should test building the package by only fetching (when possible) the dependencies from hackage, just like it would happen if someone was trying to install your project -- e.g, we would fetch hslogger from hackage if trying to build happstack-server.
- Maybe we should also try to build the project with the HEAD versions of the dependencies (if we specify a repo for them)? That would thus let the developer of the project anticipate some breakages with upcoming versions of the project's dependencies.

Basically, we may have to do some distinction between a pure "Testing" mode, that would only try building against the hackage versions of the dependencies, and a kind of "Advanced testing" mode that would fetch the development versions of the dependencies from their repositories. The former would be perfect for on-commit builds and for nightly builds, while the latter would only make sense for nightly/weekly builds, for example.
