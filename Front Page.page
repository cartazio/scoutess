# scoutess, a Haskell build bot for cabal-powered projects

The *scoutess* project aims at providing the Haskell community a powerful and viable build bot with a few key services like dependency tracking, on-commit build testing, nightly builds with handling of multiple GHC versions (and dependency versions?), report generation, etc. 

The "clean" build process will be discussed on a separate page: [Build Process]().

# Plan/ideas

## List of services we want to implement
- Checking if dependencies are out-of-date
- Reporting commits on IRC
- On-commit builds
- Nightly builds
- Report generation/posting

## Uncategorized
- The scoutess tool should have a (Haskell!) config file, that could be reloaded to enable/disable services, tweak some options, etc;
- The features of scoutess should be separated into *parts* and we should be able to enable/disable each of them;
- The reports generated by scoutess should be exported (for now) as some JSON that would be POSTed to some URL that would be given in the configuration file;
