# scoutess, a Haskell build bot for cabal-powered projects

The *scoutess* project aims at providing the Haskell community a powerful and viable build bot with a few key services like dependency tracking, on-commit build testing, nightly builds with handling of multiple GHC versions (and dependency versions?), report generation, etc. 

## Build Process
The "clean" build process will be discussed on a separate page: [Build Process]().

## Handling the dependencies

- We should track the dependencies and whenever a newer version is up on hackage, we should try building the project with the newer version. This is part of the "try building and installing the project as if you were on a fresh Haskell-Platform install" plan.
- Would it be worth it to have an optional service that would try building the project with the dependencies' HEAD versions, when they're available?

# Plan/ideas

## List of services we want to implement
- Checking if dependencies are out-of-date
- Reporting commits on IRC
- On-commit builds
- Nightly builds
- Report generation/posting

## Uncategorized
- The scoutess tool should have a (Haskell!) config file, that could be reloaded to enable/disable services, tweak some options, etc;
- The features of scoutess should be separated into *parts* and we should be able to enable/disable each of them;
- The reports generated by scoutess should be exported (for now) as some JSON that would be POSTed to some URL that would be given in the configuration file;
